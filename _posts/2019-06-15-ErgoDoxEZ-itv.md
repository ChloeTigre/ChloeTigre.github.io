## Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Chlo√©, Lead DevOps at Believe Digital (this part to be checked w/ hierarchy). I contribute to the design and realization of infrastructures and systems that deliver a huge catalog of music from all kinds of artists to streaming platforms worldwide.

I'm based in Paris but love to travel on my own whenever possible. I love (retro)gaming, anime, music and cats.

I'm also an occasional [Open Source contributor](https://www.github.com/ChloeTigre), writer and film maker.

## What hardware do you use?

At work: a 13" Macbook Pro and 2 24" LG screens (one portrait and one landscape)
At home and on the go: a 14" Lenovo T460S

As for keyboards, I use a Black, Cherry MX Brown, Glow ErgoDox EZ with sculpted blank keys, tilt kit and wrist rests, mostly at work as it is quite a bulky set.

At home I mostly use a Logitech G Series keyboard for gaming and occasionally a DIY orthogonal keyboard.

I consider buying another ErgoDox EZ set, this time Shine and White and with gaming-oriented switches.

## And what software?

At work: OSX with iTerm, Office and a Visio VM. I access a great number of Gentoo and Debian boxes.

At home and on-the-go: Ubuntu and Debian for my creative activities (i3wm), Windows for gaming.

## What's your keyboard setup like? Do you use a custom layout or custom keycaps?

The two halves of my ErgoDox EZ are spread as far from each other as made possible by the cable (which I happen to find a little short sometimes). In the middle there's often a note book and pens for my architecture work, or a 32 keys MIDI keyboard when I need to chill and let an idea infuse.

I don't use a mouse or trackpad except for gaming and Visio so I have [a WASD-like softmouse layout](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/ZOEz/latest/0) to move the cursor around my 3 screens.

I love to minimize hand movement so my keyboard is the best compromise between usability and comfort without switching to a chording device like the [Twiddler](https://twiddler.tekgear.com) (which I am considering to buy for toying).

## What would be your dream setup?

An armchair with one half of an ErgoDox EZ on each arm, a projector and an integrated sound system. I love to have my arms spread in order to minimize strain.
