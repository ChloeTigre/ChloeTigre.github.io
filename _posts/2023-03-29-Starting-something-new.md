title: Starting something new
---

## Well,

that website was getting stale. I never had a taste for blogging. I'm a micro-blogger and I issue hot takes on stuff mostly on Twitter, sometimes Facebook. My long conversations take place on Discord rather than IRC nowadays, and conversations are where I spend most time actually.

Writing solo on a blank page isn't really my thing, not without a purpose.

## So,

I decided to wipe that website a little and refresh it. My recent departure from my now recently ex-employer, a logistics company, is the occasion to do a few things about my only presence:

1. clean-up my resume and make something nice. [See the results here](/resume/). I worked with a great coach, Silvy, to improve it (work in progress still, now I'll be improving it whenever I get the occasion)
2. make my LinkedIn presentation coherent with that resume. I used to basically not maintain it and it had become sedimented. [The new version is much cleaner](https://linkedin.com/in/matcha-d).
3. try and explain my job much better. We're not there yet, but I've planned to take time to do it. I'm great at what I do but it's neither pure engineering nor pure social stuff, it sits in-between as I "hack" tech organizations to try to make them better by focusing my efforts on developers. That's, like, super impactful, but I need to state that clearly.

## Next,

I plan to take notes about my various projects as well. ADHD doesn't help, lack of companionship in these doesn't help because I work better in a team, but I'll use this website to share project notes in the hope it helps me focus and gives me positive feedback.

I won't open it to comments or whatever, but you can always reach out on social media.

Looking forward to (trying to keep up) keeping up :)

M.
